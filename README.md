# Plant-Disease-Detection
This is the repo for my first task as an Artificial Intelligence Intern at SYNC INTERNS'. I have made a DL model for Plant Disease Detection. The project had different steps to reach the final one (Prediction). First, collecting the dataset from Kaggle, EDA, Preprocessing, Initial training for the model, Error Analysis, Fine-Tunning then saving the model and loading it for the prediction.

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
